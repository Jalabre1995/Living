# Living.js

As a person moving across the country, this application allows for the user to learn about the cost of living for a certain area fast and easy to ensure that the user will make the best decision (moneywise) that suits for the future. 

## Description

Once in the application the user will be able to make use of our search functions, that will be powered by the census’s CitySDK found here https://developers.teleport.org/api/

Using this SDK our application will have access to information on population, percentage of people living in poverty, employment statistics, average income, and average cost of housing.

With this information we will be able to compute, given a user’s input on their income level, what income they would need to be able to maintain the same standard of living in the new city.  Ideally the user will also be able to have other information that they would like to see chosen to be displayed.

Our application should be able to store users, requiring a login and password, and will also be able to store recent searches for the user in our database.
